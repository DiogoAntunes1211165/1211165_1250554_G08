# Technical Memo: Supporting Multiple Databases through Configuration

| Element   | Statement regarding the need for database flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Stimulus  | There is an inability to use different types of Database Management Systems (DBMS) when requested by the product owner.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Stimulus Source | The product owner needs to use various DBMS types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Environment | The product owner’s requirement to use different DBMS types currently necessitates maintaining separate branches or projects, increasing the risk of code duplication and complicating maintenance.                                                                                                      |
| Artifact  | The LMS Software, specifically its persistence layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Response  | Enable data persistence across multiple data models (e.g., relational, document) and various DBMS (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis) using interfaces for different implementations. Utilize Spring Boot’s @Profile annotation to configure the active DBMS dynamically based on the environment. |
| Response Measure | It should be possible to switch the data model and DBMS used solely through configuration within 30 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
